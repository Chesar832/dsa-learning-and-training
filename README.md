# Data Structures & Algorithms - Learning and Training

![img](https://coe.alfaisal.edu/assets/images/se/se.jpg)

📘 This is a repository for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms to improve problem-solving skills, logic, and DSA knowledge. Includes implementations, explanations, and practice problems.

📚 This repo was intended to be used as a guide to really understand foundational topics for computer science, data structures, and algorithms.

📝 Initially, the repo contains theory and personal notes and some resources inside of them, but the approach that I'm using to learn consists of learning foundations and then practicing them with LeetCode, so you will have multiple solved exercises too.

📖 This repository has been greatly inspired by the following books:
- **Grokking Algorithms** by Aditya Bhargava: A friendly introduction to algorithms with easy-to-understand illustrations and examples.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy** by Narasimha Karumanchi: A comprehensive guide to understanding data structures and algorithms with practical problems and solutions.
- **Introduction to Algorithms** by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein: A widely used textbook that covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, with rigorous analysis and proofs.

## 🗂️ Data structures

### Why learn about it?
Data structures are part of the core of Computer Science. This because hey help to organize data, optimize resources (time, memory and efficiency), avoid security risks and solve difficult problems.

They are everywhere, and learn them provides us a set of tools that improves our approaches to solve problems (even for the easiest ones) which makes us better engineers.

### What are they?
They are a way to organize and store data in a computer or a programming language. They define a relationship between the data elements, the operations we can apply to them and the limitations to change/update the data in them.

There's no such a thing like the always-work data structure, instead of that we need to think about the use that our data structure will have and choose a suitable one that fits to our problem in the most efficient way.
